    "que_hice": "Built the Studevs website (v1): full-stack foundation using Angular with a MongoDB-backed data model for members, projects, events, and awards. Designed the database schema; implemented REST endpoints and data access patterns. Hand-coded UI components and state flows; implemented routing, lazy loading, and responsive layouts. Established a clean module structure and reusable component library (Atomic principles) to speed future contributions."

    "que_hice": "Implemented ~65% of the frontend: Next.js file-based routing (e.g., /class/[id]), join-with-code flow, chat layout, message cards, and topic chips. Built a reusable component set (cards, inputs, nav, modals) and responsive styles; mixed Tailwind utility classes with hand-rolled CSS where needed. Wired placeholder services and state for future AI/analytics integration; kept the frontend backend-ready for rapid hooking."
